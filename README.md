# Count-the-Non-Repeated-Numbers-Between-a-range
This Java program counts numbers in a given range `[n1, n2]` that have all unique digits. It checks each number by extracting its digits and tracking them using a boolean array. If a digit repeats, the number is skipped. Otherwise, it is counted. Finally, the program prints the total count of such numbers.
